## üöÄ Pipeline

We are currently implementing a **GitHub Actions** pipeline (work in progress) to automate the testing, linting, and publishing process for the project. This will ensure:

1. Every pull request is automatically tested using **Vitest**.
2. Linting is enforced with **XO** to maintain code quality.
3. Successful changes are packaged and prepared for **npm** publishing.

---

### Future Steps
- Automating the publishing process to **npm** after tests pass on the `main` branch.
- Adding coverage reports for better code health insights.
- Ensuring cross-environment compatibility testing.

Stay tuned for updates!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Linting with XO

We use **XO** as our linter because it enforces best practices and works seamlessly with TypeScript and JavaScript projects.

To run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

For more details, check out the official [XO documentation](https://github.com/xojs/xo).

## üß™ Testing with Vitest

We use **Vitest** as the test framework because it's modern, fast, and supports both TypeScript and ES Modules seamlessly.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

For more details, check out the official [Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/).
